InterpolationCurvePalette.vcxproj.filters
     This is a filter file for a VC++ project generated by the Application Wizard. This file contains information about the associations between files in your project and filters. This association is used by the IDE to indicate grouping of files with similar extensions on a particular node (for example, ".cpp" files are associated with the "Source Files" filter).
